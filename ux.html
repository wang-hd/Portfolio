						<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">
							SCORE Ann Arbor is a non-profit organization that offers mentoring and educational workshops for small businesses (SCORE Association, 2021). SCORE files have multiple versions that are being updated, so the chapters became unorganized over time. To understand how the volunteers use the shared Google Drive in their working context and what exactly causes the problems, we did some background research, interviewed 5 SCORE members with different job roles, and analyzed the information in detail to come up with recommendations that may help SCORE to organize their chapter data.

						<h3>Steps of Consulting</h3>
							<h4>Researching and Initial Interview</h4> 
							<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">
								In this project, we used multiple approaches to identify and find solutions to the problem. To better understand the background of the project and the problems, we conducted an interview with the stakeholder and got some basic information about the project. Then we did background research and compiled reports in three aspects: the background about the client, the background about the problem, and the background about potential competitors. We identified the problem of file management in Google Drive and referred to some articles on related topics to get a better understanding of the file management structure. We also found some of Ann Arbor SCOREâ€™s potential competitors and studied their approaches to file management.

							<h4>Generating Interview Protocol and Conducting Interviews</h4>
							<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">
								After getting basic information about the projects and problems, we made an interview protocol based on the initial results of background research and questions we were concerned about. Then we conducted five interviews with the stakeholder and members of Ann Arbor SCORE. During the interviews, we asked questions about the usage and experience of Google Drive and took notes about the pain points mentioned by the users.  
							</p>
							<h4>Building affinity map and making recommendations</h4>
							<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">
								After finishing all five interviews, we summarized the annotated interview notes and made the pain points into an affinity map. We then classified the notes in the affinity map into three main aspects and came up with three main problems of the current file management system:  lack of naming conventions and version control, unorganized file structure, and misaligns between file structure and volunteers mental model. Based on the three problems we identified, we made several recommendations to improve the current file management system.

						<h3>Steps of Consulting</h3>
							<h4>Conducted client meetings and interviews</h4> 
							<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">
								As a consulting group, we met with Underground Printing representatives to discuss their needs and objectives. We asked questions to gain a deeper understanding of the company's challenges and opportunities. We also conducted interviews with key stakeholders to gather more detailed information.

							<h4>Designed and distributed a user experience survey</h4>
							<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">
								To better understand the user experience of Underground Printing's online ordering system, we designed a survey and distributed it among potential target users via email, social media, and other channels. We collected responses over a period of several weeks.

							<h4>Collected and analyzed survey data</h4>
							<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">
								Once we had collected a sufficient number of survey responses, we began the process of analyzing the data. We looked for key trends and insights that would help us develop recommendations for improving the online ordering system. We also created charts and graphs to visualize the data.</p>

							<h4>Conducted background research</h4>
							<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">
								In addition to the survey, we conducted background research on direct and indirect competitors of Underground Printing. We looked at their websites, marketing materials, and online reviews to get a sense of their strengths and weaknesses. We also reviewed industry reports and other relevant sources to gain insights into best practices.

							<h4>Developed recommendations</h4>
							<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">
								Based on the survey data and research findings, we developed a set of recommendations for improving Underground Printing's online ordering system. We worked together as a consulting group to refine our ideas and make sure they were practical and achievable. We also created a report outlining our recommendations.
